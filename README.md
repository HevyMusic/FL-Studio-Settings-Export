Export your settings with this simple batch script

# Info

* This is provided as-is, so there is no guarantee or promise
* This was made for my personal use
* If you install FL Studio into a different path than on the older computer, then it might break, so you should check the paths in the created file.
* It's old and hacked together, I started a Python version with a better menu and everything, but that is something for the future if I ever have the time or find enough fun in making a better tool out of it
